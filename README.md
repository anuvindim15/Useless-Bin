# [ USELESS BIN] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [IDEATORS]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [VISHNU VINAYAKUMAR] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING VADAKARA]
- Member 2: [ANUVIND I M] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING VADAKARA]
  

### Project Description
[Our useless project is an useless bin which opens when senses the object within 20cm from the bin and moves backward for 15cm and at the same time bin closes. So that no one can dumb waste in to this bin. ]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We are not allowing anyone to dumb waste inside the bin.]
